# Euler-Project
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 

In the beginning of my programming career, I realized, that most programming/computing solutions are based on creativity/logic and mathematical aproach. Thinking "outside of the box" is the key to create well functional/efficient algorithms and code.
To practice, I began to solve Euler-Projects problems. 

Each section consist code written in VBA, however, I am also translating it to Java to practice both languages syntax.
